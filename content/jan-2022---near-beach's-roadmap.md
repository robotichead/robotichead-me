The following article is a plan for NearBeach that is only relevant on Jan 2022.
Progress on NearBeach will most likely change the direction we are taking with
this road map. We are hoping to include new and shorter road maps in the future.

# Jan 2022 - NearBeach Road Map

## New NearBeach Features

- Epics/Sprints: We want to add in the ability for users to create their own epics or
sprints.
  
- RFC improvements: We want to finally add in features that have been requested for
RFC's.
  
- Speed up Kanban board: We know that the kanban board can be slow at times. The good
news is we know how to fix this and will be implementing it in the 0.29.* branch.
  



## New Development Goals

- Tree Shaking - we want to make sure the JS compiles to the smallest possible file.
- Type Script implementation
- Improve test coverage for both Python and VueJS


## New System admin Goals

- Docker implementation
- Deploying NearBeach on k8s
- Auto deployer finally fixed


# Long Term Goals

The following are still on our list, and we want you to know. However we just don't 
have either the time or funding to pursue these at the moment.

- Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket intergration
- Construct YouTube vidoes on how to use NearBeach
- Update Dashboard, create better widgets on the dashboard
- Build an email que, so emails can be sent to the appropriate users
- Fix up the profile images for users, customers, and organisations
- Kanban board improvements which include
  - Auto block/complete dialog that asks the user to write some notes. So future users
  know why the card is in that status
    
  - Cards to contain checklists
  - Assign cards to users
  - Add labels/tags to cards
  - Delete cards and links
  
- Implementation of a Gnatt chart. We have put this off for a very long time and we
are hoping to get it started very soon.
