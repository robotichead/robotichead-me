I have been asked this question a few times, and in reality the answer is not that complex.

# Django

NearBeach started out as a learning project (it has since evolved well beyond that). I knew a little of PHP however my
Python knowledge was a lot stronger. So I simply googled "Python web framework". Django was the first response. After 
completing the tutorial within 20 - 30 minutes, I was up and running and writing the first lines of NearBeach. That is 
literally the whole story.

If it had been a different framework that appeared at the top, I would most likely be talking about how I am currently
using that framework.

TLDR: Django appeared at the top of the search

# VueJS

I started learning VueJS in my previous job. I have since then used it for multiple different projects 
successfully. Back in August 2020, I had decided to rewrite all of NearBeach (deleted about 95% of the code base). The
two main frameworks I was thinking of using for the frontend were either ReactJS or VueJS. The only reason why VueJS
won out of the two was due to the fact I am more familiar with it.

TLDR: I was more familiar with VueJS

# Other Languages/Frameworks

I am not a person who likes to stay on one framework or language. Since learning how to program, I have used the 
following languages/frameworks;

- C
- C++ with Qt Framework
- C# for Umbraco
- Matlab
- Python, Django
- PHP, Laravel, WordPress
- Ruby, Ruby on Rails
- VueJS, React

These will NOT be the only languages/frameworks I'll ever use, and I am looking to expand my knowledge.
